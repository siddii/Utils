##cd-dash-dash
**cd-dash-dash** is a shell utilty that helps *changing directories* from the history of previously visited directory paths
of the current session. 
As you may know this already, <code>cd --</code> can take you to the last visited directory from the command shell. 
What if you could change directory to a specified one from the list of previously visited directories? And, here you have it.
